## Adding New Benefits

Do you know a benefit that is missing in the list? Open a GitHub issue or simply edit `benefits.json` and make a pull request. Each benefit has the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Service Name",
  "description": "Description of the student benefit",
  "imageSrc": "URL to the service logo/image",
  "tags": ["Category1", "Category2"]
}
```

The `description` property is the only one allowed to contain HTML elements (like `<br>`, `<a href='https://example.com'>example.com</a>`, `<strong>important</strong>` or similar).

The `imageSrc` can be an external link, but for speed performance it's better if it is a local relative path. You can download the logo or image locally and use [optimize-image.py](/assets/optimization-script/) to convert it to a 350px wide WEBP image (optimized version). Then put the optimized image in the benefits folder.

An additional boolean key `campusRequired` can be set to `false` for indicating that enrollment can't be done directly by the student (it needs to be done either by a professor or by the whole university or campus).

## About this site code
The front-end was initially very simple, simple GH pages site, images fetched from the internet, etc. Check: [fba6e4a66c633b7172dffc9949e4ec2f6ccb1da4](https://github.com/Mapaor/student-benefits/tree/fba6e4a66c633b7172dffc9949e4ec2f6ccb1da4).

Then basic SEO optimizations were made, robots.txt, sitemap.xml and JSON-LD were added and images were optimized and locally stored, see: [1d16bf4dc86f95500f9bedf90514e42d775270a5](https://github.com/Mapaor/student-benefits/tree/1d16bf4dc86f95500f9bedf90514e42d775270a5).

Then SEO performance was not great, so for enabling cache headers migrated from GH Pages to Vercel, see: [a49408ce2874d49f316dd748732e365f6b003f4d](https://github.com/Mapaor/student-benefits/tree/a49408ce2874d49f316dd748732e365f6b003f4d).

And finally modified some styling and script loading to improve LCP (Largest Content Paint) and CLS (Content Layout Shift) scores.

## Adding New Benefits

Do you know a benefit that is missing in the list? Open a GitHub issue or simply edit `benefits.json` and make a pull request. Each benefit has the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Service Name",
  "description": "Description of the student benefit",
  "imageSrc": "URL to the service logo/image",
  "tags": ["Category1", "Category2"]
}
```

The `description` property is the only one allowed to contain HTML elements (like `<br>`, `<a href='https://example.com'>example.com</a>`, `<strong>important</strong>` or similar).

An additional boolean key `campusRequired` can be set to `false` for indicating that enrollment can't be done directly by the student (it needs to be done either by a professor or by the whole university or campus).
